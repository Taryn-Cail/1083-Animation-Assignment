This program involves two classes to run the main programs as well as two sub classes used in the animation.
The snowman class depicts a winter scne drawn using a group layout manager and carefully thought out polygon lines.
The marchbreak class depicts three people and a dog jumping up and down after winning a game of fortnite, using
the dog and person class and timing the animation loop.

Enjoy!
